% Read lumonisity data from a ThingSpeak channel and remove outliers, if 
% present. Write the cleaned data to another channel for storage. 
   
% Channel Smart home simulation (ID 1643575) contains data from real sensor station, located 
% in Sfax, Tunisia. The data is collected once every 1/2 minute. Field 
% 4 fields contains 2 metrics data (analog and val for each). 
   
% Channel ID to read data from 
readChannelID = 1643575; 
% Luminosity Field ID (row) 
lumFieldID = 2; 
%Number of recods to read (lines)
points= 100;
   
% Channel Read API Key   
% If your channel is private, then enter the read API Key between the '' below: 
readAPIKey = ''; 

% Read the last data from the smart home simulation
% station channel. Learn more about the thingSpeakRead function by going to 
% the Documentation tab on the right side pane of this page. 
   
[lumVal,timeStamp] = thingSpeakRead(readChannelID,'fields',lumFieldID, ...

% We will use the isoutlier function. With the default settings, this   
% calculates whether a value is more than three scaled median absolute 
% deviations away from the median. (See MATLAB documentation for the   
% isoutlier function for more details: 
% https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/isoutlier.html) 
% If any such points are found, we   
% will delete the point and the corresponding timestamp. 

% Check for outliers 
% Find the indices of elements which are outliers 
outlierDataIndex = isoutlier(lumVal); 

% Find the indices of elements which are not outliers 
cleanDataIndex = ~outlierDataIndex;

% Select elements that are outliers 
outlierData = lumVal(outlierDataIndex); 

% Select elements that are not outliers 
cleanData = lumVal(cleanDataIndex); 
   

% Select timestamps corresponding to outlier data 
outlierTimeStamps = timeStamp(outlierDataIndex); 

% Select timestamps corresponding to clean data 
cleanTimeStamps = timeStamp(cleanDataIndex); 

% Create a table with outlier data and their respective timestamps 
outlierDataTable = timetable(outlierTimeStamps,outlierData); 

% Create a table with clean data and their respective timestamps 
cleanDataTable = timetable(cleanTimeStamps,cleanData); 

display(outlierDataTable,'Outlier data'); 
 
% If you need 
% Replace the [] with channel ID to write data to: 
writeChannelID = []; 

% Enter the Write API Key between the '' below: 
writeAPIKey = ''; 
% Use the folwing code to write (deleta '%'):
%thingSpeakWrite(writeChannelID,cleanData,'timestamp',cleanTimeStamps,'Writekey',writeAPIKey);
